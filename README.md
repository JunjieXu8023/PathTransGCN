# PathTransGCN
In this study, we propose a multi-omics integration model based on pathway self-attention and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) — named PathTransGCN, which incorporates cancer-specific pathway information into multi-omics data analysis with the aim of improving the accuracy of complex disease classification.
